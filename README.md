# Smash Bros
Koombea Smash Bros Ultimate test app

## Overview

* App follows MVVM architecture. 

* `Single Activity` pattern with `Navigation` component. 

* Initially thought of using `Room`, but the API is not clear on when to refresh previously stored data, so skipped persistence altogether, 
effectively using only web requests.

* Figma uses raw pixels, so all margins and sizes in the app are approximate.
